Dear Sir/Madam,
</p>

<p>
I am Foo Lye Heng from Penang, Malaysia. Currently, I am doing freelance jobs and contracts
(assignments and/or hourly basis) from freelancer.com, nine.is web development agency, and
some local agencies.
</p>

<p>
I have over 20 years of experience in large multi-national companies (MNCs).  Over these 20 years, I have
had vast experience in many areas in semiconductor chip design. I have supported design automation,
and ASIC physical design in state-of-the-art semiconductor industry.
</p>

<p>
When I was With Intel Corporation, I have supported many EDA design tools from Synopsys,
Cadence and Mentor Graphics, ranging from front-end simulation tools
and back-end physical design tools to physical design verification tools for tapeout.
</p>

<p>
When I was with Marvell Semiconductor, I was the physical design technical lead in
several customer chips. These chips contains state-of-art ARM64 microprocessor,
with many advanced IPs like USB3, HDMI and Gigabit Ethernet and PCIE 3.0.
</p>

<p>
And over the past 5 years, I have ventured into a new career in the web and software
development areas. I have done lots of self-learning from various sources,
and built up my capability to be able to take up freelance jobs on web development
& software development as a freelancer.
</p>

<p>
With my vast knowledge and experience in areas of VLSI IC design, tool and design automation, software development
and computing technology, I would love to give back to the future generations. Personally, I am very enthusiastic
to share what I learnt over 20 years in semiconductor industry, web development and software development.
I would always get very excited whenever there is such opportunity to share.
I am a hard-core believer of this - one learns when one shares his knowledge.
To me, learning is a life-long process, and it must never stop.
</p>

<p>
Teaching is something that I enjoyed since I was young.
Professionally, I have taught a few 2-full-days classes to PSDC
Higher Diploma students on “Designing with MaxPlus-II” subject, about 20+ years ago.
It was indeed a pleasure to see how well and excited my full-time students picked up
the new skill.
</p>

<p>
I have also taught “Micro Processing System" and "Digital Signal Processors” modules
for the Executive Diploma for Electrical and Electronic Technology programme,
an initiative from University of Technology Malaysia (UTM) Kuala Lumpur
to promote and enable working adults to study part-time for their career advancement.
Teaching working adults was a very challenging task. Considering that they did not have the luxury of time
to learn everything needed to equip themselves to face the industry challenges, it was my
responsibility to make sure these working adults could still benefit from the programme, despite
very little time to study on their own. I had made sure that the learning was fun, and tailored
these modules to be more practical and applicable in their current career path.
</p>

<p>
Over the years in the corporate world, I have coached & trained many new engineers.
I have always emphasized on managing projects in a way that people learnt from working
in the project. Coaching in this manner is an art, and I have always found it interesting
and enjoyed the challenges ahead. One of the main challenges is that
every individual needs to be coached uniquely.
And what was more satisfying is seeing the results of how well the coaching works for
these individuals, and when they were promoted faster than their peers.
From the 360-degree feedbacks that I have gotten over these corporate years, one of my
key strengths has always been my clear, detailed and focused coaching and providing
guidance capability.
</p>

<p>
Academically, I have completed my Masters Degree in Computer Science (CGPA 3.5). I was
the best overall graduating student (Texas Instrument Prize Award) for my First Class Honours
Bachelor Degree (in Computer Systems Engineering) from the renowned University of Warwick, United Kingdom.
I have also completed GCE A-Level with straight A's.
</p>

<p>
With my right personality and exposure to teach both academically and
non-academically, I can see myself playing an important role in your learning center,
and how the future generations can benefit from my experience and knowledge.
</p>

<p>
I look forward to this opportunity to teach in this highly sought-after learning center.
I hope we can meet up soon to chat more on how I could help.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your time.
